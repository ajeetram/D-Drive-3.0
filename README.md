# D-Drive-3.0

D-Drive-3.0 is a decentralized drive in which we can store our documents. It uses Interplanetary File System(IPFS) for storing and sharing data peer to peer network.It provides a good interface on which anyone can store their data and can share also. To making this project i have used solidity language to write smart contract and for testing and deployment smart contract i have used hardhat.Front-End interface has build by using javascript React.js.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
