D-Drive-3.0 is a decentralized drive in which we can store our documents. It uses Interplanetary File System(IPFS) for storing and sharing data peer to peer network.It provides a good interface on which anyone can store their data and can share also. To making this project i have used solidity language to write smart contract and for testing and deployment smart contract i have used hardhat.Front-End interface has build by using javascript React.js.
